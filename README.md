# US Population Income Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the income levels of U.S. citizens using census data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to build a model that can accurately classify individuals based on their income.

## Project Overview

The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that determines whether an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold based on various demographic and employment-related attributes.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships between features.
- **Model Training:** Implementing machine learning algorithms, particularly focusing on the Random Forest classifier, to predict income levels.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and refining it through hyperparameter tuning.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Tools:**
  - Jupyter Notebook
